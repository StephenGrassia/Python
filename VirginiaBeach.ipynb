    "Virginia Beach, Virginia is an independent city in the Hampton Roads Region in SouthEastern Virginia. With a population of roughly 450,000, it is the largest city in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the 42nd most populous\n",
    "city in the United States. It has the longest pleasure beach in the world, 28 miles, making Virginia Beach a tourist destination. Even though it is a large city, its population is mainly suburban with the main \"urban\" areas being the OceanFront, and Town Center. \n",
    "\n",
    "Virginia Beach has been constantly ranked as one of the safest big cities. However, like with every city, there is crime. Utilizing the \"Virginia Beach Police Incident\" dataset from the \"Virginia Beach Open Data\" portal, we will analyze crime in Virginia Beach from 2018 - 2023.\n",
